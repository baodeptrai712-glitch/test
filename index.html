      <h2>What are games</h2>
    <p>
      A game is a structured type of play usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes
      used as an educational tool. Many games are also considered to be work (such as professional
      players of spectator sports or video games) or art (such as games involving an artistic layout
      such as mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many types of games; popular formats include board games, video games, online games,
      and card games. Games can be played in a variety of circumstances, and some can be played even
      without any materials or company. Games can be played either for enjoyment or for competition;
      they can be played alone or in teams; they can be played offline or online.
    </p>
    <p>
      All games must have a challenge and a structure; barring certain exceptions like sandbox
      games, all games also have an objective. Multiplayer games also include interaction between
      two or more players. Not all forms of play are considered games; toys and puzzles, for
      instance, are not games, as they do not have a structure.

    <h3>When and Who created it </h3>
    <p>In October 1958, Physicist William Higinbotham created what is
      thought to be the first video game. It was a very simple tennis game, like the classic 1970s video game Pong, and it was quite a hit at a Brookhaven National Laboratory open house. 
     </p>

     <h3>Why do games exist</h3>
     <p>Games exist to entertain, challenge, and bring people together. They allow players to relax, escape daily stress, and experience stories or competitions in an interactive way. Through games, people can learn problem-solving skills,
           teamwork, and creativity while having fun.</p>
